# In Person and Online learning #
This module will be delivered **in-person** in the Dyson Building Level 3.
Check your timetable for session times.

We’ll be using a variety of online learning tools,
some you will have used before.

## Timetabled sessions – Microsoft Teams ##

The lecture slides will be made available on Google Drive.
Lecture recordings will be on teams.

## Code repository – GitHub ##
It is also where all the code examples that I use in the timetabled sessions
will be linked on github.

## Resource repository – Blackboard ##
[Blackboard course page](https://bb.imperial.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_2478605_1&course_id=_35044_1)

Links to all this, and access to some of the tools will be on Blackboard.

## Discussion Forum – Ed
We will be using Ed as a discussion forum.
Ask and answer questions, share insights, and help each other out!
There is the potential for extra credit for good citizenship - at the module leader's discretion.
