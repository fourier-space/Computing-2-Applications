The timetabled sessions in this module will be delivered in person and live-broadcast on Teams.

Lecture recordings will be on teams.

## Code repository – GitHub ##
It is also where all the code examples that I use in the timetabled sessions
will be linked on github.

The assignment submission is through GitHub Classroom
– the link for this is provided on Blackboard.

## Resource repository – Blackboard ##
[Blackboard course page](https://bb.imperial.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_41153_1/cl/outline)

Links to all this, and access to some of the tools will be on Blackboard.

## Discussion Forum – Ed
We will be using Ed as a discussion forum.
Ask and answer questions, share insights, and help each other out!
There is the potential for extra credit for good citizenship - at the module leader's discretion.
