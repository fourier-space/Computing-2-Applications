## In Person and Online learning ##
This module will be delivered **in-person** in the Dyson Building Level 3.
Check your timetable for session times.

We’ll be using a variety of online learning tools,
some you will have used before.

### Timetabled sessions – Microsoft Teams ###
[MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aKlZPWfW04pEOUo7T2fbY7QMF1IYhZrAGEGhSrtUXq4k1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=589bb1bf-7a20-474e-aa73-dbc666ec3bda&tenantId=2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307)

The timetabled sessions in this module will be delivered in person and live-broadcast on Teams.
The usual format will be 1h of plenary followed by 1h of tutorial sessions.
Each of you will be assigned a table with a teaching assistant where you can bounce ideas off each other.
I’ve set up a the groups on teams as an additional space for your table.
