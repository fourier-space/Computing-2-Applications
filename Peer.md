## Peer review ##
In this module, you will have the opportunity to engage in peer review.
This is a formative exercise,
but participation will gain 2.5% extra credit for participating and providing feedback, and an extra 2.5% for is that feedback was useful.

For the peer assessment you will submit a draft version of your final project
on Github Classroom and you will be paired anonymously with another student
to mark each other’s work to the module’s assessment criteria.

The purpose of this exercise is that by seeing other people’s code and going
through the steps of marking it to the criteria,
you will learn more about your own approach to coding and how best to succeed in
the module.
The feedback you provide each other will also provide an important point of
reference for your project particularly for the user interface and experience
you present.

Peer assessment will happen in Week 7.
In the week, you will have time to prepare your draft submission for
assessment, and will have time to assess and write
feedback for your assigned project.
You will receive your feedback in time for you to reflect on it for
the final submission.
