## You Said, We Did – Changes from last year
In response to student feedback and to improve the module,
the following changes have been made from last year.

### Constrained submission – Game
Students had found the assignment brief too open ended previously.
This made it difficult to know where to start.
The brief is now a game (details below),
which will make it easier to target the assessment criteria of the module.

### Structured submission
Common feedback from last year was that it was difficult to know how to get started.
This year the submission is sectioned into separate parts,
Game Module (API and Implementation), Unit Tests (Specification and Implementation), and Web App.
This will assist in getting started on the project,
but also train good practices in structuring of your software project.
The module's assessment criteria have been rewritten for this new structure.

### Example coursework
Students often ask for a previous example of a coursework submission,
it can be difficult to provide this as there are changes to the submission requirements from year to year.
So I've prepared an
[example submission](

)
that fits this year's requirements.

### Reduced Scope
This is a one-term module in computing and web applications.
There's lots of exciting further directions you can go in
following on from this module, including: Generative Property Based Testing, Databases, External APIs, Sessions, etc.
These used to be part of the coursework brief, but are no longer so.
You're welcome to explore these and chat to me about them,
but they're no longer part of the *Excellent (A)* criteria,
and we won't cover them in the taught sessions.
The server side aspect of a web app is still included but its scope is reduced to the client's interactions with a server.

### Starter Code
The directory structure of a web app can get complicated.
There's lots of configuration files for different parts of the tooling,
as well as directories for different aspects of the app.
I provide starter code for your submission that sets this up with sensible defaults.
Submissible webserver code is also included that can form part of your web app.
This is automatically copied when you create your submission repository on GitHub Classroom,
[but the template can also be found here.](

)

### Peer Assessment
Peer assessment has run every year, and has been very useful to the students who have participated.
Previously this has been formative only,
but to encourage engagement, bonus credit is available for participation.
